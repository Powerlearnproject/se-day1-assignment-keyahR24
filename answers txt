Software engineering applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. 
importance of software engineering is that it enables the creation of software application that power various aspects of modern life including communication.

Three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering are
 -development of programming languages such as C
 -The establishment of software engineering as a discipline which has helped in development of softare sysytems.
-The advent of structured programming and agile methodologies.

phases of software development life cycle are
-Requirements which include gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
-Design which involves creating high detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
-Implementation which involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
-Testing which involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
-Deployment which involves releasing the software to users or customers.
-Maintenance which involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the software after deployment

comparison and contrast of agile methodologies
-waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing down like a waterfallwhile agile is iterative and icremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Roles and responsibilities of
-Software developer,responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions
-quality assurance manager,ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
-project manager,oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Importances of IDES and VCS in the software development process
-IDES,provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code such as the VS Code
-VCS, used to track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members such as git and subversion.

Common challenges by software engineers and strategies to overcome
- challnges are tight deadlines
-changing requirements
-technical debt
strategies to overcome- effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassesment of project tasks.

Different types of testing and importance
- testing types are unit testing,intergration testing, system testing and acceptance testing.
-importance of testing is that it ensures products reach quality standards.

Prompt engineering and its importances
-prompt engineering is the crafting of questions to get the best responses from AI models
-its importance is that it help AI models give clear and concise response to the crafted questions.

Provide an example of vague prompt
-vague prompt, what is software engineering
-improved prompt, explain software engineering using simple language easily understood by a 10 year old
-the improved prompt is more effective as it will provide more detailed and concise information
